                <h2>WeLearn</h2>
                <p>In 2019 I conducted a full redesign of Wirral Councils LMS: ULearn, introducing new functionality,
                    improved UX and UI, and a repurposed catalogue of content spanning over 3000 items.</p>
                <h3>Benefits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li data-title="Interactivity">Additional functionality was introduced including open badges, RSS
                        feeds, notifications and a
                        manager dashboard. Underused social functionality, surveys and feedback also began to be
                        utilised.
